    "# Lab 4 - Information Theory in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this week's lab on Information Theory! This week, we will dive into the fascinating world of Information Theory as applied to Machine Learning. Specifically, we will focus on two key concepts: Entropy and Information Gain. These principles are fundamental in understanding how decision trees make split decisions to organize data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy\n",
    "- Entropy, in the context of information theory, measures the level of uncertainty or disorder within a set of data.\n",
    "- In machine learning, particularly in decision trees, entropy helps to determine how a dataset should be split. A high entropy means more disorder, indicating that our dataset is varied. Conversely, low entropy suggests more uniformity in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Gain\n",
    "- Information Gain measures the reduction in entropy after the dataset is split on an attribute.\n",
    "- It is crucial in building decision trees as it helps to decide the order of attributes the tree will use for splitting the data. The attribute with the highest Information Gain is chosen as the splitting attribute at each node."
